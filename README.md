# Tic-Tac-Toe
This game was developped in Visual Studio in C# as Windows Forms. It replicates the real life Tic-Tac-Toe game that requires two users to play, with each taking their turns. It accounts for all win conditions, and was used to practice widget design, and programming with images made in Paint.
